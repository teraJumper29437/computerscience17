   <p>  Welcome to the All Saints Catholic School website! 
This wonderful educational institution was established in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1996, in the name of Jesus Christ, as a result of the dedicated Archbishop, faculty, administration, staff, parish communities, and strong parental support.
The school moved from its original location at Saint Joseph Parish on the east side of Norman, to its present location on the west side, in 1998. We have grown from a student body of 160 in the 
first 2 years to serving nearly 400 students from Norman and surrounding towns. In 2007, we received national recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. 
In addition, we are dually accredited through the Oklahoma Conference of Catholic Schools Accrediting Association (OCCSAA) and the State of Oklahoma.

   <p>  All Saints Catholic School seeks to develop God-given talents in students . 
    The school offers an atmosphere that is respectful and stimulating. 
    Educational lessons, religious experiences, service to community, athletic endeavors, and social 
    interactions are hallmarks of the school. We wish to form happy, well-educated individuals. In learning by example the sacrifices
    parents and teachers make for them, students come to realize their potential, intellectually and spiritually.
    Our goals are to integrate a studentâ€™s academic experiences with the teaching of Christian values so graduates will enjoy 
    faith-filled, meaningful lives.
    
      Students at All Saints learn that each of us is called to give back to God and others by using the talents and gifts 
    bestowed on us by God. Service to those in need is a way to express our faith and engage in the principles of Catholic
    Social Teachings. The seven Catholic Social Teachings are 1) Life and Dignity of the Human Person, 2) Call to Family,
    Community, and Participation, 3) Rights and Responsibilities, 4) Option for the Poor and Vulnerable, 5) The Dignity of
    Work and the Rights of Workers, 6) Solidarity, and, 7) Care for God's Creation. All Saints strive to give all of our students 
    the opportunity and experience to develop the compassion, morality, courage, critical thinking, and academic knowledge 
    to be responsible stewards in today's society. The school can do this only with the grace of the Holy Spirit and the support of
    our community. 
    
     Each class engages in a year-long service project. The projects are hands-on and give direct service.
    Examples of past student experiences include sorting food and filling bags at the Oklahoma Regional Food Bank,
    landscaping at Saint Joseph Parish, recurring trips to Rosemont, Legend and Saint Anne's Retirement Centers,
    sharing in activities at Among Friends Activity Center for Developmentally Disabled Adults and Full Circle Adult Da
    y Care Center, painting rooms at Sooner Theater, supporting a seminarian, cleaning warehouse space for the Oklahoma
    Safe Kids Coalition, delivering food to Meals on Wheels of Norman, and taking supplies to Second Chance Animal Sanctuary. 
    These projects have given their students a new perspective about our world and their role in it as disciples of Christ.
    
      Along with the class service experiences, All Saints have participated as a school in the Christmas Adopt-A-Family Program through
    Catholic Charities of Oklahoma and through the Saint Vincent de Paul Society. Students and families donate gifts of clothing,
    food and shopping cards to families that are needing our help. Birth Choice is another agency supported by our school through
    donations of baby items. As we look to serve on a global scale, we support Hope Village in Haiti, Operation Rice Bowl, 
    Catholic Relief Services and Heifer International through Mass collections and special donations. 
    Working through these groups, All Saints Catholic School, as a faith community, strive for positive change in the world.
