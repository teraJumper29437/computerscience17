   <h1> All Saints School</h1>
   <p> Welcome to the All Saints Catholic School website! We have designed the site to be simple to use and showcase our mission, students, and staff.
This wonderful educational institution was established in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1996, in the name of Jesus Christ, as a result of the dedicated Archbishop, faculty, administration, staff, parish communities, and strong parental support.
The school moved from its original location at Saint Joseph Parish on the east side of Norman, to its present location on the west side, in 1998. We have grown from a student body of 160 in the 
first year to serving nearly 400 students from Norman and surrounding towns. In 2007, we received national recognition as a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. 
In addition, we are dually accredited through the Oklahoma Conference of Catholic Schools Accrediting Association (OCCSAA) and the State of Oklahoma.
